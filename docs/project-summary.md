# AIBugReport Project Summary

## Project Overview
AIBugReport is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for efficient and intelligent bug tracking. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and decentralized storage to streamline bug reporting workflow and provide developers with comprehensive information to resolve issues quickly.

## Current Status
The project is currently in the planning and design phase with no code implementation yet.

## Key Features
- CLI-centric interface for bug tracking operations
- Intelligent bug analysis using LLM (via MCP)
- Rich attachment support (screenshots, documentation) via Pinata/IPFS
- Project-based bug organization
- MySQL database for structured data storage
- Extensible architecture
